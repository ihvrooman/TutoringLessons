/* This is a console application. When you run it, it uses the
 * Windows console user interface.
 * 
 * You can use the static Console class to interact with the user.
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console?view=net-6.0
 * 
 * Exercise - Weather Application:
 * Use this existing console application to create an interactive
 * weather application.
 * 
 * The user should be able to:
 *      Get the current weather conditions
 *      Get the weather forecast for the week
 * 
 * To implement this, you'll need to create a Weather Simulator which
 * simulates whether conditions.
 * 
 * Then create a WeatherService which interacts with the Weather
 * Simulator.
 * 
 * Think about what types of objects your user is interacting with
 * and create the appropriate classes to create those objects.
 * 
 * Remember that there is no 'right' or 'wrong' answer. It's better
 * to build something and then improve it later if needed than to
 * not build anything at all for fear of writing the wrong code.
 * 
 * Be sure to include unit tests for your project!
 * 
 * Note: To run the console application, right click on the project
 * and then click 'Set as Startup Project' in the context menu.
